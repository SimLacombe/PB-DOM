# PB-DOM
In this repositoyy I develop a Process-based Dynamic Occupancy Model to map species range dynamics across large (e.g. national) scales, with a colonization process emerging from an explicit dispersal kernel.
This model is particularly suited for species with expanding ranges like invasive species or recolonizing species. Here we test the model across simulations from various scenarii as well as two case-studies from otter (Lacombe & al., 2025) and wolve (Louvrier & al., 2017) recolonization in France.
