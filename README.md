In this repositoyy I develop a Process-based Dynamic Occupancy Model to map species range dynamics across large (e.g. national) scales. The colonization process emerges from an explicit dispersal kernel. The model is particularly suited for species with expanding ranges like invasive species or recolonizing species.
